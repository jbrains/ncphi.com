Over the past few years I have read increasingly about Systems Thinking. Here are some of the best books I've read on the subject.

**[Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603580557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1603580557&linkId=aab051f0d29a584576b267755960ea31)** by Donella Meadows is a phenomenal introduction to systems thinking. Free of mathematics and technical jargon, this book will prepare you to look around for the systems in our world.

**[The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0884271951/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0884271951&linkId=3975b9658142437e1791b41ff7efabde)** by Eliyahu Goldratt is the book I recommend the most. As a business fable, it uses the socratic method to teach the Theory of Constraints and how to apply reason in improving systems.

**[Seeing Like a State](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300078153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0300078153&linkId=d3004d5bb588d14d867de3a007e73d43)** by James C. Scott gives fascinating accounts of how over simplified models of the world have been detrimental. Covering topics such ecology, to surnames, and property ownership, this book is a deep and engaging read.

Similarly, these next three books by Nassim Nicholas Taleb have given me a better sense of how inaccurate systems models can be dangerous and what we should do about that. Taleb's writing style is controversial but his ideas are definitely worth reading.

In **[Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975219/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0812975219&linkId=ce844e59120583993a5f565330037337)** Taleb sets out to show how randomness in our society deserves much more credit then it gets.

**[The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081297381X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=081297381X&linkId=a3166330518afa7c7e99d55840ce9246)** expanded on this theme in a in-depth discussion on _the problem of induction_ and the impact of unpredicted yet highly impactful events.

In his fourth book, **[Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ncphi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkId=a76ec6e2d7fd648c60f4c986e700e8f4)**, Taleb talks about how uncertainty can be used to our advantage. After reading the first two books I came away confused about the implications of these ideas. Antifragile alleviated my confusion by introducing concepts that I find incredibly helpful.
